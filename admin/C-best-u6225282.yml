declaration: >-
  I submit the work below for assessment as my best work. I declare that this
  is entirely my own work, with the following documented exceptions:

# Use this to list any code that you used that you did not write,
# aside from code provided by the lecturer.  Provide a comment
# explaining your use and the URL to that code and the licence for
# that code

# I completed task 2, 3, 5 and 7 for this part.
# And after communication, we decided to submit code of Juren's and HongGic's due to the quality.
# So I have no code submitted here. But I still save them in my own computer.
