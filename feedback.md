## Tutor Comment

**I can't run your game.jar file, neither your game itself. If you believe it's
not the case, please contact me ASAP.**

Hey team, good effort in implementing this game!


Reading your code, I can see concise and clear comment with enough authorship
details.
Your use of javadoc provides me with a structure easy to follow, explaining
purpose of the method and important features of the interface.
Your testing suite contains useful tests of various aspects of the assignment.
I'm really glad that your code follows a sensible and consistent style, with
meaningful names and data structures.
I can also see a good use of OO in your program, where you designed multiple
classes and methods with obvious responsibilities. This has greatly helped with
the separation of concern in your game.

I can capture your excellent teamwork with your git commit history. Your git 
commit messages are appropriate and indicate healthy software engineering 
practices.

~~Turning to your game, failing to run your game means I can't assess how good
your game is.~~

Some advice: (also delivered to the group via call)
1. Some text prompts.
2. Considering insightful approach to apply the AI.

Overall, I'm very pleased with the work that you have done with this assignment.
Congratulations on this achievement.

[Fix: the student can run the game on their device and lab VM.]
