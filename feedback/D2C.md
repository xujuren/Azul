## Group Feedback
Please try to breakdown git commits into multiple small stages, instead of saying
"finish .... all tasks". The messages are meaningless for later track.
The game itself is yet to be playable, as I failed to load the necessary elements
on the viewer.
With regard to the overall design, I suggest you have a reflection on lab6 content.
Is the string representation ideal for a large program such as this assignment?
What will Object orientation benefit you?

By the way, can you remove "gittest" folder in your `src` directory?
The `src` directory should be used explicitly for source code.
